# AI World Cup Predictor: using ML to Forecast the Outcome of the biggest soccer tournament
Welcome to my Github project that aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the 2022 World Cup, along with a classification model to predict the winners of each game until the final to determine the overall winner of the tournament. My model accurately predicted Argentina as the winner of the World Cup.

### Data
The data for this project was obtained from the Kaggle open dataset titled "International Football Results from 1872 to 2022" (https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2022). It consists of results from international football matches played between 1872 and 2022.

### Analysis
My analysis includes a thorough exploration of the data, including statistical analysis of past World Cup performances by various countries and identification of any trends or patterns that may be relevant to predicting future performance. I also conducted analysis on various factors that could impact a team's chances of winning, such as the home field advantage and the strength of the team's defense.

### Classification Model
Using the insights gained from my analysis, I developed a classification model to predict the winners of each game until the final to determine the overall winner of the World Cup. The model was trained on a subset of the data and tested on the remaining data to ensure its accuracy. The model was able to accurately predict Argentina as the winner of the World Cup.

### Conclusion
I hope that my analysis and classification model will provide valuable insights and predictions for the 2022 World Cup. Good luck to all the teams competing in the tournament!
